# LLMs Feature Engineering Bias

Welcome to the LLMs Feature Engineering Bias repository!

This project is currently still in development, and there are no active files regarding bias evaluation at the moment. This repository contains the implementations from the [[link arxiv]] paper. The proposed context aware feature generation method, as defined in the paper, is publicly available at the [CAAFG](https://github.com/automl/CAAFG) repository.

Please check back later for updates regarding further implementation details.
