# Large Language Models Engineer Too Many Simple Features For Tabular Data

Welcome to the LLMs Feature Engineering Bias repository!

This repository contains the implementations from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17787). The proposed context-aware feature generation method, as defined in the paper, is publicly available at the [CAAFG](https://github.com/automl/CAAFG) repository.
